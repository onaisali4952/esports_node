This project features a website that can be used to manage an esports team. 

Implementation is done locally. To start the project, run
```bash
npm start
```

It includes both an admin and employee view that is based on who is logging in. Admins are allowed to add scheduled matches as well as handle the company's finances whereas employees can see upcoming matches and who is on the current roster as well as a history of all played matches with scoreboard details and YouTube links to the match recordings.

Implemented using Supabase as the database.
